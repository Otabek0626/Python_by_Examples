 Learning to Program in 150 Challenges
Python is today’s fastest growing programming language. This engaging and refreshingly
different guide breaks down the skills into clear step-by-step chunks and explains the theory using brief easy-to-understand language. Rather than bamboozling readers with pages
of mind-numbing technical jargon, this book includes 150 practical challenges, putting
the power in the reader’s hands. Through creating programs to solve these challenges the
reader will quickly progress from mastering the basics to confidently using subroutines,
a graphical user interface, and linking to external text, csv and SQL files. This book is
perfect for anyone who wants to learn how to program with Python. In particular, students
starting out in computer science and teachers who want to improve their confidence in
Python will find here a set of ready-made challenges for classroom use.
